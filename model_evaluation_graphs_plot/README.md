This folder contains results data and codes for evaluating model performance, as well as the code for plotting all the graphs in the report

- Note that the **Datetime** column in the results data represents the execution time for forecasting. For example, if we consider a 2-step forecasting (1 hour ahead), if the Datetime is 08:00, then the corresponding value in the other column would be the time value of 09:00.
